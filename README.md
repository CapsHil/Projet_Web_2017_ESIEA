# ESIEA WEB PROJECT 2017
## AIL5MAJ - INF5041

This project was made by FALEMPIN Charlotte, GILLES Vincent, MARIAUX Corentin, RABY Pierre and SPIR Ã‰mile-Hugo

### Blind-test rules

  You have 3 game modes :
  - Classic with 4 propositions
  - Classic without propositions
  - Ranked with 4 propositions : number of extracts are fixed, and you will be able to record your score at the end of the game
  
  In classic mode, you can choose your number of extracts.
  You also could choose your category (like series, films, 80s, classic...).
  
  You will have 10 seconds unless you click on button, and then 3 seconds to see the answer.
  If you play without propositions, you can skip the extract when you found it.
  
  *Enjoy !*
  
  Note : Due to the fact that the project is not deployed in production, you only have few extracts in `Serie/Film` and `Musique`, but you can easily add many extracts and categories by addind them to the database.

### How to run all services

Assume that you have Docker (https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and docker-compose version 1.16.1 or later installed (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), and enought disk space to pull images
- `docker-compose up`

### Run fake backend
- In `fake-backend`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

## Backend architecture

The backend rely on a couple of REST APIs.
It expects format passed either via GET or POST.
It returns a JSON format containing a `status` entry containing either `success` or  `error`.
If `error` was returned, a short message describing the issue is appended in an `error` entry.

### Overview

| Component | Method | Description | Arguments | Output on success |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ | ------------ | --------- |
| **test.php** | POST | Provide test data | `nbSuggestions` containing the number of plausible answers to return. This parameter is optionnal, the API will default to 4 suggestions. `genre` contains the array of requested genres. This parameter is optionnal and will items will be ignored if invalid (invalid genre ID, no song with give ID...) | `songID` (the ID the real song), `filename` (the name of the file to play), `suggestions` (an array of items containing the `songID` of the suggestion, `trackName` and `artistName` to craft the suggestion). In order to let the frontend format it properly, the trackname and the artist name aren't merged beforehand |
| **messages.php** | GET | Return recent messages | `nbMessages` the maximum number of messages to return. This parameter is optional, the API will default to 200 messages. | Return messages sent since a givent `lastMessageID` | `lastMessageID` containing the ID of the lastest message returned by the API and `messages`, an array of messages sorted from earliest to lastest composed items containing `messageText`, `user` and `time` |
| **messages.php** | GET | Return messages sent since `lastMessageID` | `lastMessageID` (the last message of the previous request, will only returns messages after this one) and optionnally `nbMessages` (same default as `getMessages.php`). | Same output as `getMessages.php`
| **messages.php** | POST | Post a message to the chatbox | `username` of the user posting, `message` to post | None |
| **genres.php** | GET | Get available genres | None | JSON with a `genres` entry containing an array of couples `name` and `ID`  |
| **genres.php** | POST | Create a new genre | `name`, the name of the genre to create | `genreID`, containing the newly created ID of a genre with the name provided. If a genre with the same name already existed, its ID is provided. |
| **song.php** | POST | Create a new song | `trackName`, `artist` and `genre` (the genre must be a valid genre ID). The name of the field passed as the source of the file is expected to be `fileToUpload` | None |
| **topScores.php** | GET | Get highest ranking users with their high scores | `nbResults`, the maximum number of top results expected. This parameter is optionnal, the API will default to 20 top scores. | `scores`, an array of items containing `rank` (counter starting from 1), `user` (the name of the user), `score` (the number of maximum correct answer for this user) |
| **topScores.php** | POST | Commit top score to database | `username` of the current user, `strike` containing the score | None |
